<b><left>Enoki is a species of edible mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. It is well known for its role in Japanese cuisine, where it is also known as enokitake. 

The mushroom naturally grows on the stumps of the Chinese hackberry tree (Celtis sinensis) and on other trees, such as ash, mulberry and persimmon trees. Enoki can be sourced September- March and has been named winter fungus due to its seasonality. Wild forms differ in color, texture, and sliminess and may be called futu, seafood mushrooms, winter mushrooms or winter fungus, velvet foot, velvet stem or velvet shank</left></b>
